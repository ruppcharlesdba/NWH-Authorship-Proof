Chapter 11 - The Leader Compass
 The Leader Compass: Recalibrating Direction Through Honor
Every organization needs strategy. Every leader needs direction. But without a moral compass, both become navigation without north—efficient motion toward uncertain ends.
The Leader Compass is the final synthesis of Negotiating with Honor: a framework that integrates principle and performance. It is less a map than an orientation device—a way to return to alignment when circumstances shift, when pressure mounts, and when conviction collides with convenience.
The Four Bearings of Honor
•	True North – Integrity: Am I acting consistently with my stated values?
•	East – Empathy: Do I understand the human impact of my decisions?
•	South – Courage: What am I willing to risk for what is right?
•	West – Wisdom: Have I learned from what this experience is trying to teach me?
When these bearings are aligned, the leader compass points toward honorable action even in moral fog. When they diverge, decision-making becomes reactive—recalibration is overdue.
